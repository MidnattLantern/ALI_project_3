--- How to find k-value for 2-point equation ---

- A linear 2-point equation is represented as:
  y = kx + m
- If the equation is consistent, which means
that the changing value is always the same,
then you can choose any two points on the graph
- You should have a pair of x-values and y-values.
- subtract the second value from its first:
  y2 - y1
  x2 -x1
- divide the result of y by x:
  y / x
- This will return the k value in the formula.
