--- How input works ---

My Math Pilot can recognise and understand
your input by generating a polynomial and
monomials. When asked for input, you can
type in an expression such as "2x^3+4y-5x^5".
In this example, My Math Pilot will generate
three monomials:
  ( +2x^3 )
  ( +4y )
  ( -5x^5 )
Each monomial will be assigned a unique
index number:
  0 for ( +2x^3 )
  1 for ( +4y )
  2 for ( -5x^5 ) 
When you run a program, such as a linear 2p equation
you will be prompted to enter the index number
for the corresponding monomial when asked
for input. This way, My Math Pilot can process
your input accurately.
